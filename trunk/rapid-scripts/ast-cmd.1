.B call 
options:

  -f FROM_CHANNEL
  -F FROM_EXTEN (-f or -F is required). Context is 'default' if ommited.
  -t TO_EXTENSTION (required). Context is 'default' if ommited.

Generates a call from a specified channel or extension to a specific 
extension. If the source is an extension, the call is genrated from a 
Local channel.

This generates a call file and drops it into Asterisk's outgoing spool.
Thus it only requires write access there. E.g: to generate a call echo-test 
call to phone 501:

  ast-cmd -F 200 -t 501 call

.B inst-cfg 
options:

  DEB_PACKAGE (default: /media/cdrom0/ast-cfg.deb)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ast-cmd 
is a small script for all the extra functionalities we needed.
Thus it has a number of independent
.I commands.
I expect that the commands 
.I call, sip-pass, iax-pass 
and
.I vm-pass
will be useful to others as well.

.B hostname
assumes that the hostname in /etc/hosts is in the entry of 127.0.0.1 .
This is how it was in my test system.

.B mysql-pass
Assumes that the password is either empty (installation default) or is
already written in the file /root/.my.cnf , which allows it access to the
mysql server. After a successful password change it will write the password 
to that file as well to allow the root system user password-less access to 
the root mysql user. Note that the command rewirtes /root/.my.cnf

.B mail-cfg
Sets up simple exim4(8) configuration using update-exim4.conf(8) (whose 
config file is /etc/exim/update-exim4.conf.conf). Sets up a "sattelite"-type
host that will relay all mail to the SMTP server from the command-line, and
sets the domain to the one from /etc/resolv.conf.

If you need a more custom mail server setup, use:
.RS
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
.RE
(tip: to exit from that wizard of the above command without a change, 
answer "yes" to the first question, and then press Esc twice).


.SH add-line

has two modes of operation: Mode 1: extension number is given:
  
  ast-cmd -u iax:tzafrir -p xxxx -c 607 -n "Tzafrir Cohen" -e tzafrir.cohen@xorcom.com

In this case it will also generate an extension in the context phones
and a voicemail box with the same number.

Mode 2: no extension number is given:

  ast-cmd -u iax:tzafrir -p xxxx 

Only generate a SIP/IAX line


.SH add-trunk
allows setting a SIP or IAX trunk. The \fBname\fR parameter is used to 
set the context into which the trunk will ring, as well as for all the 
files generated. For an \fIIAX\fR trunk, The script generates the following 
files:

.I /etc/asterisk/iax-reg.d/\fBname\fI.conf

.RS
for registrating to the provider
.RE

.I /etc/asterisk/iax-phones.d/trunk-\fBname\fI.conf

.RS
The \fIIAX\fR peer needed to connect to the provider.
.RE

.I /etc/asterisk/iax-phones.d/\fBuser\fI.conf

.RS
The \fIIAX\fR user needed to authenticate calls from the provider.
with a FWD connection, \fIfwdiax\fR is always used as the user here.
.RE

.I /etc/asterisk/extensions.d/trunk-\fBname\fI.conf

.RS
A dialpan snippen: the context \fItrunk-name\fR that contains the 
required extensions to dial \fIto\fR the trunk using the prefix 
\fIprefix\fR. Consider \fIinclude\fR-ing that context in other 
contexts (e.g: \fIdefault\fR) to allow calls to the trunk.
.RE

.I /etc/asterisk/extensions.d/from-\fBname\fI.conf

.RS
A dialpan snippet: the context \fIfrom-name\fR into which calls
\fIfrom\fR the trunk land. You should probably edit this file to 
fine-tune the "permissions" by including the relevant 
that contains the required extensions to dial \fIto\fR the trunk 
using the prefix \fIprefix\fR.
.RE

.B Known trunks

.B fwd

.RS
an IAX connection to Free World Dialup. You should register to FWD
and then use the web interface to set account type to 'IAX'. Use the 
following page:

http://account.freeworlddialup.com/index_new.php?section_id=112

Then use the command:

  ast-cmd -f \fIprefix\fR -u \fInum\fR -p \fIpassword\fR -s fwd add-trunk \fIname\fR

  ast-cmd -f 8 -u 611334 -p xxxx -s fwd add-trunk fwd-tr

FWD only supports ulaw (g711u), unless you buy some g729 licenses. This 
means it requires more bandwidth than other services. OTOH, it is free
and quite popular. A simple way to test your setup.

Try calling 612 for a clock or 613 for an echo test. 
http://account.freeworlddialup.com/index_new.php?section_id=76 from the 
web interface can be used to send a call to you.
.RE

.B sipphone

.RS
a SIP connection to SipPhone.com. After you register with to SipPhone
you can use the command:

  ast-cmd -f 8 -u \fInum\fR -p \fIpassword\fR -s sipphone add-trunk \fRname\fI

  ast-cmd -f 11 -u 17476065631 -p xxxx -s sipphone add-trunk sipphone-com
.RE

.B voipgate

.RS
an IAX connection to VoipGate. After you register with them
you can use the command:

  ast-cmd -f \fIprefix\fR -u \fIuser\fR -p \fIpassword\fR -s voipgate add-trunk \fRname\fI

  ast-cmd -f 834 -u vg-username -p xxxx -s voipgate add-trunk vg
.RE

.B junction

.RS
an IAX connection to Junction Networks. After you register with them
you can use the command:

  ast-cmd -f \fIprefix\fR -u \fIuser\fR -p \fIpassword\fR -s junction add-trunk \fRname\fI

  ast-cmd -f 835 -u junc-username -p xxxx -s junction add-trunk junc
.RE

.B goiax

.RS
an IAX connection to GoIAX.com. This is currently an experimental setup.
After you register with them
you can use the command:

  ast-cmd -f \fIprefix\fR -u \fIuser\fR -p \fIpassword\fR -s goiax add-trunk \fIname\fR

  ast-cmd -f 43 -u 878201000001 -p top_secret -s goiax add-trunk goiax

  This is (still?) a free service that also provides free calls to the US.
  Unlike FWD it also supports gsm, if you have less bandwidth to spare.

  To test your setup you can call the conference room at *2663 (*conf).
.RE

.B sip:\fIserver_address\fB , iax:\fIserver_address
.RS
Try to connect to an arbitrary SIP/IAX trunk. Should hopefully work.
.RE

So once you've run the command \fBadd-trunk\fR with the correct parameters, 
you should edit the relevant files under /etc/asterisk/extensions.d/ (probably 
default.conf and from-\fIname\fR.conf) and then issue a reload command.

If the host name, user name and password are correct, asterisk will probably 
register immedietly as shown in the output of the CLI command 'iax2 show 
registry' or 'sip show registry' .
